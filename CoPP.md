# CoPP - RFC 2474 (defines DS field), RFC 2475 (provides architecture for DS), RFC 4594 (config guidelines for DS)

### Overview:
> * CoPP is a security mechanism on Cisco devices that protects the control plane from traffic floods, DoS attacks or other unwanted traffic that could disrupt device operations.
> * By applying rate limits and filtering policies, CoPP ensures that only legitimate traffic reaches the control plane
> * CoPP is a vital technique for protecting Cisco devices by regulating the flow of traffic to the control plane.
> * CoPP classifies and policies traffic based on protocol and source, CoPP minimizes the risk of control plane overload and DoS attacks, thereby maintaining device stability and performance
---
### Terminology/Definitions:
> * Control Plane – the part of a network device responsible for routing protocols, network management traffic and other signaling processes. It handles critical tasks like routing updates and protocol exchanges
> * Data Plane – the component that forwards user traffic through the device based on the control plane’s decisions
> * CoPP – a mechanism that uses ACLs and QoS policies to rate-limit and filter traffic destined for the control plane. Its goal is to prevent excessive traffic from overwhelming critical processing functions
> * ACL – a set of rules used to permit or deny traffic based on criteria such as source/destination IP addresses, protocol type and port numbers. ACLs are key in CoPP for classifying control plane traffic
> * Class-Map – a mechanism used to classify traffic into different categories based on match criteria. In CoPP, class-maps identify different types of control plane traffic
> * Policy-Map – a configuration tool that defines how traffic (classified by class-maps) should be handled. Such as applying rate limits or setting drop actions
> * QoS – techniques that manage bandwidth, delay and packet loss. CoPP uses QoS policy to enforce rate limits and prioritization for control plane traffic
> * Rate Limiting – the process of controlling the rate at which traffic is allowed into the control plane to prevent resource exhaustion
---
### Objectives:
> * Protect the Control Plane – safeguard critical processing and routing function from excessive or malicious traffic
> * Prevent DoS Attacks – mitigate the impact DoS attacks by rate limiting potentially harmful traffic
> * Ensure Stability – maintain the performance and responsive of the control plane during high traffic loads
> * Classify and Prioritize – differentiate between types of control plane traffic, allowing essential protocols (like routing updates) to get priority treatment
> * When To Use MPP –
>   * On devices that are vulnerable to control plane traffic floods
>   * In environment where multiple service share the same device
>   * As part of a layered security approach to complement other protections (like MPP)
---
### Cisco Implementation:
> * Cisco devices implement CoPP by applying QoS policies (using class-maps and policy-maps) to traffic destined for the control plane. These policies are then bound to the control plane interface. The policies filter and shape traffic, ensuring that the control plane receives only as much traffic as it can handle.
>   * Key Concepts:
>    * Traffic Classification – identify control plane traffic by matching protocol types (ICMP, BG), SSH, SNMP) using class-maps
>    * Policy Enforcement – create policy-maps that define actions (rate limiting, policing or dropping) for each traffic class
>    * Binding the Policy – apply the policy to the control plane using control-plane command or through dedicated control plane interfaces
### Key Benefits:
> * Traffic Filtering – CoPP protects the router's control plane by filtering out malicious or unnecessary traffic destined for it. This ensures that only legitimate traffic (such as routing protocol updates and management traffic) reaches the CPU
> * Preventions of DoS Attacks – by policing traffic to the control plane, CoPP helps prevent DoS attacks. Excessive traffic (from floods, DDoS attempts or misconfiguration) is dropped or rate-limited, preserving CPU resources
> * Resource Preservation – CoPP ensures that the control plane is not overwhelmed by unnecessary packets, allowing the router to maintain stable routing and management functions even during traffic surges
> * Improved Convergence – with fewer extraneous packets reaching the CPU, routing protocols can converge more reliably, leading to quicker recovery from failures
> * Granular Control – administrators can define specific policies that rate-limit or drop certain types of control plane traffic based on criteria like protocol type, source/destination address or port numbers
> * Prioritization – CoPP allows you to prioritize critical control traffic over less important traffic. For instance, routing protocol messages can be given higher priority than SNMP or management traffic
> * Logging and Monitoring – CoPP configurations often include logging of traffic drops and violations. This information can be used to identify abnormal patterns or potential security incidents, providing insights into control plane health and traffic anomalies
---
### Use Cases:
> * Enterprise Edge Routers and Switches – protect control plane functions on devices handling high-volumes of management traffic and routing traffic
> * SP Devices – in multi-tenant or high-traffic environments, CoPP prevents control plane overloads, ensuring continued protocol exchanges and management access
> * Data Centers and Cloud Networks – maintains stability and performance in complex environments where control plan stability is critical to service delivery
