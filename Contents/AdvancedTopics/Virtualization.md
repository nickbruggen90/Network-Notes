# Virtualization/Segmentation – RFC 7348 (VXLAN), IEEE 802.1Q, 802.1X

### Overview:
> * Virtualization and segmentation form the backbone of modern network design. They not only improve security but also enhance performance and scalability.
> * In networking, virtualization and segmentation refer to techniques that logically divide a physical network into multiple isolated virtual networks. These approaches provide better control over traffic, enhance security and improve scalability by segregating different user groups, applications or tenants.
> * Common segmentation technologies include VLANs, VRF, VRF Lite, Private VLANs and overlays such as VXLAN.
> * Virtualization can also extend into the realm of network functions (NFV) and SD-Access to further abstract and centralize network control.
> * Effective segmentation can contain security breaches, optimize traffic flow and reduce broadcast-related congestion – essential factors in enterprise and data center environments
---
### Terminology/Definitions:
> * Virtualization – the creation of virtual network resources. In networking, this often means creating virtual switches, routers or even entire network segments on shared hardware
> * Segmentation – the process of dividing a network into smaller parts to improve performance, enhance security and reduce congestion. It can be implemented at different layers (VLANs at L2 and VRFs at L3)
> * VLAN – a method to create separate broadcast domains within a single physical switch, typically identified by a VLAN ID
> * PVLAN – a variation of VLANs that provide further segmentation within a single VLAN, isolating ports from each other while still being part of the same primary VLAN
> * VRF – a technology that allows a single router to maintain independent routing tables. This enables overlapping IP addresses and secure, isolated VPNs within the same device
> * VRF Lite – a non-MPLS version of VRF used primarily in enterprise networks for segmentation without the overhead of full MPLS implementation
> * VXLAN – an overlay protocol that encapsulates L2 frames in UDP packets, allowing the creation of virtualized networks over a L3 infrastructure. It greatly expands the available number of segments via the VNI
> * VNI – a 24-bit field in the VXLAN header that uniquely identifies a VXLAN segment or virtual overlay network. It allows for up to 16 million distinct segments, facilitating scalability, multi-tenant environments by isolating traffic within separate logical networks
> * SD-Access – an architecture that uses virtualization and policy-based automation to segment and manage both wired and wireless networks through a centralized controller
> * Underlay – the physical network infrastructure that carries traffic
> * Overlay – the virtualized network created on top of the underlay, which provides segmentation and isolation
---
### Architecture:
> * Virtualization/Segmentation creates separate logical networks on the same physical infrastructure. This ensures that traffic in one segment does not interfere with or access traffic in another, improving security and performance
> * L2 segmentation is achieved through VLANs and PVLANs, which isolate broadcast domains
> * L3 segmentation is implemented using VRF/VRF Lite, where each VRF maintains its own routing table. This enables the creation of multiple virtual networks (or VPNs) on a single router, each with overlapping IP address spaces if needed
> * Technologies like VXLAN allow the creation of virtual networks that span across physical locations. The overlay decouples the logical segmentation from the physical network, offering flexibility in data center interconnect and cloud environments
> * SD-Access integrates segmentation with centralized policy management. SD-Access uses virtual overlays (often based on VXLAN) to enforce segmentation, while a centralized controller (Cisco DNA Center) manages policies across the entire network
---
###Design Considerations:
> * Scalability – choose appropriate segmentation technology based on network size. VLANs are suitable for smaller deployments, while VRF, VXLAN and SD-Access support large-scale, multi-tenant environments
> * Security – segmentation improves security by isolating sensitive data and reducing the attack surface. Ensure that each segment has proper access control measures (ACLs, 802.1X, etc)
> * Performance – proper segmentation reduces broadcast traffic and limits collision domains, leading to improved network performance
> * Management – centralized management tools and automation (Cisco DNA Center) can simplify the administration of segmented networks, ensuring consistent policy enforcement and easier troubleshooting
---
### Key Benefits:
> * Enhanced Security – segmentation limits broadcast domains and isolates sensitive data
> * Optimized Performance – smaller segments reduce congestion and improve network efficiency
> * Scalability – virtualization techniques (VRF, VXLAN) support large-scale, multi-tenant environments without requiring additional physical infrastructure
> * Simplified Management – centralized policies and automated provisioning of virtual segments streamline network management
---
### Use Cases:
> * Enterprise Environments – separate different departments (Sales, HR, Finance) using VRF or VLAN segmentation
> * Data Centers – use VXLAN overlays to extend L2 domains across large data centers and cloud environments
> * SP Networks – isolate customer traffic using VRF in MPLS VPN
> * Wireless Networks – segment guest and corporate traffic, ensuring security and proper QoS
> * Multi-Tenant Environments – use VRF and overlay technologies to provide isolated virtual networks for different customers on shared infrastructure
---
### Best Practices/Security Considerations:
> * Proper segmentation prevents unauthorized lateral movement. Ensure that sensitive segments (finance, HR, etc) are isolated from general traffic
> * Use ACLs and 802.1X to restrict access to each segment
> * For data travelling between segments over an untrusted medium, consider using IPsec or MACsec
> * Monitor segmented networks for unusual cross-segment traffic, which might indicate a breach
> * Secure management interfaces for controllers and devices that configure VRF, VXLAN or VLAN settings
> * Define clear segmentation policies based on business requirements, considering security, performance and management
> * Use clear naming conventions and IP addressing plans for each segment (VLAN, VRF, VXLAN) to simplify troubleshooting and administration
> * Deploy centralized management tools (Cisco DNA Center, Prime Infrastructure) to monitor segmented networks and adjust policies as needed
> * Use network automation tools to deploy segmentation consistently across devices and sites
> * Keep detailed records of your segmentation architecture, including IP addressing, VLAN assignments, VRF configurations and overlay parameters
> * Combine segmentation with robust security policies (ACLs, 802.1X, encryption) for layered defense approach
> * Validate segmentation designs (VLANS, VRFs, VXLAN overlays) in a controlled environment before full production rollout

### Troubleshooting:
> * VLAN Issues?
>   * Ensure that all devices are correctly assigned the intended VLAN
>   * Check that trunk ports allow the necessary VLANs
> * VRF Routing?
>   * Verify that routes are correctly imported/exported between VRFs
>   * Confirm that interfaces are properly bound to VRFs
> * VXLAN Overlay?
>   * Ensure the source interface for the NVE is up
>   * Check BGP EVPN configurations if using an overlay control plane
> * General Segmentation Problems?
>   * Use ping/traceroute to test connectivity within and across segments
>   * Review ACLs and security policies that might inadvertently block traffic between segments
