# IP SLA - IP Service Level Agreement
*Cisco proprietary*

## Overview
• IP SLA is a feature developed by Cisco that enables network devices to actively monitor network performance metrics in real time  
• By generating synthetic traffic (probes) and measuring key parameters - such as round trip time (RTT), jitter, packet loss and latency  
• IP SLA helps network administrators verify if network services are meeting the required performance standards  
• **IP SLA plays a critical role** in proactive network monitoring, service assurance and triggering automated responses (like failover or routing changes) based on performance thresholds  
• **IP SLA provides invaluable real-time performance data** that can preemptively alert you to issues before they affect end-users

## Timers

| Timer Type | Purpose | Configuration |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| **Frequency Timer** | Specifies how often the IP SLA operation sends a probe | Interval in seconds between probes |
| **Timeout Timer** | Maximum time to wait for a probe response | Time in milliseconds before declaring probe lost |
| **Thresholds** | Defined values for performance metrics | Maximum acceptable jitter or delay values that trigger alerts |
| **Lifetime** | Duration of the IP SLA operation | Often set to "forever" in production, specific duration for testing |

---

## Multicast

### Multicast Considerations
• **IP SLA probes are typically unicast** → However, you may use probes to measure performance over multicast paths indirectly  
• **Especially when using UDP-based operations** with multicast receiver endpoints  
• **IP SLA itself does not generate multicast packets** but can help measure multicast path performance when combined with tools like IP Multicast Routing and PIM

## Protocols/Ports

| Operation Type | Protocol/Port | Description |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| **ICMP Echo** | IP Protocol 1 (no port) | Basic connectivity and RTT measurement |
| **UDP Jitter** | Dynamic UDP ports (16384-32767) | Delay variation measurement |
| **VoIP RTP Jitter** | UDP with dynamic ports | Voice traffic specific performance |

---

## Terminology/Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **IP SLA** | A feature that creates synthetic traffic flows (probes) to measure network performance metrics |
| **Probe/Operation** | The synthetic traffic generated by IP SLA to simulate real application traffic |
| **RTT** | Round Trip Time - the total time for a probe to travel from the source to a target and back |
| **Jitter** | The variation in RTT between successive IP SLA probes, crucial for real-time applications |
| **Frequency** | The interval (in seconds) between each IP SLA probe |
| **Timeout** | The period within which a probe is expected to receive a response before it is considered lost |
| **Threshold** | A user-defined value for performance metrics (RTT, jitter) that, when exceeded, can trigger an alert or automated action |
| **Operation Type** | Different types of IP SLA operations, such as ICMP Echo, UDP Jitter, VoIP or HTTP, each measuring specific performance characteristics |

## Architecture

### Core Components

| Component | Function | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Probe Generation** | Create synthetic traffic | Network device (source) generates synthetic probes toward a target IP address using specified operation type |
| **Measurement Collection** | Gather performance data | Device measures performance metrics such as RTT, jitter, packet loss or delay |
| **Data Analysis** | Process results | Results are stored locally and can be viewed in real time or used to trigger automated reactions |
| **Integration** | Connect with other tools | IP SLA can be integrated with network management and automation tools (SNMP, NetFlow, etc.) |

### Monitoring Approach
• **Active Monitoring** → Unlike passive monitoring (NetFlow), IP SLA actively sends synthetic probes to measure network performance  
• **Dynamic Adjustments** → Results can be used to adjust routing or trigger failover mechanisms automatically  
• **Centralized and Distributed** → IP SLA operations can be monitored and managed locally on a device or centralized via a network management system

## Best Practices/Security Considerations

### Traffic and Performance Management
• **IP SLA generates synthetic traffic** that could potentially be misinterpreted as unwanted load if misconfigured  
• **Ensure that the frequency and type of probes** are carefully planned  
• **Ensure that additional traffic from IP SLA operations** does not impact normal network performance, especially in high-frequency configurations

### Configuration Guidelines
• **Set appropriate frequencies and timeouts** to balance between timely measurements and network overhead  
• **Configure thresholds and timers** based on the specific performance requirements of your applications  
• **Lab your IP SLA configurations thoroughly** before deploying them in production

### Security Implementation
• **Secure management access** to IP SLA configurations to prevent unauthorized modifications  
• **Use role-based CLI views or privilege levels** to restrict IP SLA configuration commands  
• **Be cautious when simulating VoIP probes across WAN** - avoid exposing your testing IPs to untrusted paths without firewall inspection

### Monitoring and Integration
• **Combine IP SLA with secure, centralized monitoring solutions** (SNMP or syslog) to maintain an audit trail of performance data  
• **Integrate IP SLA with centralized monitoring systems** to gain comprehensive visibility  
• **Keep detailed records** of your IP SLA operations including configuration parameters and performance baselines

### Security Specific Considerations
• **If using HTTP probes** sanitize target URLs to avoid security scanning alerts or web server misuse  
• **Implement proper access controls** for IP SLA configuration and data access  
• **Monitor for unusual patterns** that might indicate misuse or security issues
