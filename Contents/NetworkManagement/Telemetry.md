# Telemetry - RFC 8040 (RESTCONF), RFC 6241 (NETCONF)

### Overview:
> * Telemetry in networking refers to the automated collection and streaming of device and network data in real time. Unlike traditional polling-based management (SNMP), telemetry pushes data continuously or on a scheduled basis from network devices to collectors or analytics platforms. This approach enables network operators to monitor performance, detect anomalies and troubleshoot issues proactively with near real-time insights.
> * Telemetry is becoming increasingly relevant as networks grow in complexity and scale, and as organizations move toward software-defined and intent-based networking
> * Telemetry represents a major shift from traditional polling (SNMP) to a push-based model that provides real-time visibility with lower overhead
---
### Timers:
> * Sample Interval Timer – defines how often telemetry data is sent
> * Subscription Lifetime – some telemetry systems allow you to define how long a subscription remains active before it must be renewed
> * Retransmission/Keepalive – protocol-specific timers may be in place (especially with gNMI) to ensure that the connection between the device and collector remains active. These are generally configurable on the collector side or within the devices telemetry settings
---
### Terminology/Definitions:
> * Telemetry – the automated, continuous collection and delivery of data (such as platform metrics, configuration status and error statistics) from network devices to a centralized system for analysis and monitoring
> * Streaming Telemetry – a method of telemetry where network devices push data in real time to collectors, using protocols such as gRPC, NETCONF or RESTCONF, often with data encoded in JSON or XML
> * YANG – a data modeling language used to define the structure of configuration and operational data for network devices. Telemetry systems often use YANG models to structure the streamed data
> * gRPC (Remote Procedure Call) – an efficient, open source, high performance RPC framework developed by Google. Based on HTTP/2, it supports multiplexed streams, binary data via protocol buffers (protobuffs), and bidirectional communication. It allows a clients (collector or controller) to call methods directly on a remote server as if they we local.
> * gNMI (gRPC Network Management Interface) – a protocol built on gRPC that provides streaming telemetry and configuration management. It leverages YANG models and is increasingly used in modern network management
> * Collector/Analytics Platform – a centralized system (or software platform) that receives, stores and analyzes telemetry data from multiple devices. This can be a commercial solution or open-source tools integrated into the network management system
> * Polling vs Telemetry – polling (using SNMP) involves periodically querying devices for status, while telemetry pushes updates automatically without the need for repeated requests
---
### Architecture:
> * Telemetry Architecture –
>   * Data Source (Network Device) – devices (routers, switches, firewalls, etc) run telemetry agents that collect performance metrics, configuration data and operational statistics
>   * Transport Mechanism – telemetry data is sent from the device to a collector using protocols such as gNMI (via gRPC), RESTCONF or even proprietary methods. Data is usually encoded in JSON or XML for easy parsing
>   * Collector/Analytics System – a centralized platform receives telemetry data, aggregates it and provides dashboards, alerts and analytics. This system enables proactive network monitoring and rapid troubleshooting
> * DataModeling with YANG –
>   * YANG Models – telemetry data is structured using YANG models. This ensures consistency across devices and vendors. For example, common YANG models may define interfaces, routing protocols or system health metrics
>   * Standardization – using standardization YANG models (as promoted by organizations like IETF) facilitates integration with third-party systems and automation tools
---
### Operational Overview:
> * Continuous Data Streaming – telemetry agents on network devices continuously push data to collectors. This can be configured to send data at regular interval or only upon significant changes
> * Event-Driven Updates – some telemetry systems allow event-triggered reporting, where data is sent only when a threshold is crossed (high CPU utilization or interface errors), reducing unnecessary traffic
> * Integration with Automation – telemetry data can feed into automated systems (such as Cisco DNA Center or custom scripts) to trigger responses like rerouting, load balancing or alerts for manual intervention
> * Comparison with Polling – traditional polling (SNMP) relied on periodic queries from a management station, which can create overhead and delay in reporting. Telemetry’s push model provides near-real-time data with lower overhead
---
### Key Benefits:
> * Real-Time Monitoring – provides continuous, up-to-date insights into device performance, interface statistics and network health
> * Proactive Troubleshooting – enables rapid detection of issues such as high latency, packet loss or configuration drifts
> * Automation and Orchestration – data from telemetry feeds can trigger automated responses (rerouting, load balancing and alert generation) to maintain network service levels
> * Enhancing Visibility – supports detailed performance analysis, capacity planning and historical trend reporting
---
### Use Cases:
> * Network Performance Monitoring – continuously monitor crucial metrics like interface utilization, CPU load, memory usage and error rates
> * Service Level Assurance – validate that network services meet SLAs by tracking latency, jitter and packet loss in real time
> * Automated Incident Response – trigger alerts or automated remediation (rerouting traffic, etc) when performance thresholds are breached
> * Capacity Planning and Optimization – analyze historical telemetry data to forecast trends and plan network expansion or upgrades
> * Integration with SDN and Automated Platforms – use telemetry data to drive automated network configuration changes through orchestration tools (Ansible, Cisco DNA Center, etc)
---
### Best Practices/Security Considerations:
> * Telemetry data is sensitive (it can reveal network topology, performance and configurations). Use HTTPS or secure gRPC (with TLS) to encrypt the telemetry data in transit
> * Ensure that only authorized systems can access telemetry data. Use strong credentials and, if available, certificate-based authentication
> * Limit telemetry access via ACLs on the device to prevent unauthorized users from querying or modifying telemetry configurations
> * Ensure that telemetry data is validated and that any anomalies (unexpected values) are promptly investigated
> * Consider privacy and regulatory requirements when transmitting telemetry data, especially if it contains sensitive operational details
> * Use standardized YANG models for telemetry to ensure consistency across devices and ease integration with third-party tools
> * Always use encrypted channels (HTTPS, TLS) to secure telemetry data
> * Balance the need for real-time data with the processing overhead on devices by adjusting sample intervals appropriately
> * Integrate telemetry with centralized management platforms (like Cisco DNA Center) for holistic network monitoring and automated responses
> * Establish thresholds for key metrics and set up alerts to trigger notifications or automated remediation when those thresholds are exceeded
> * Maintain clear records of telemetry subscriptions, data models and collector settings for troubleshooting and auditing
> * Before deploying telemetry in production, test configurations in a lab environment to ensure they meet performance and security requirements
---
### Troubleshooting:
> * No Data Received?
>   * Ensure the device’s telemetry feature is enabled
>   * Verify network connectivity between the device and the telemetry collector
>   * Check if firewall rules are blocking the telemetry port (often HTTPS on port 443 or a gRPC-specific port for gNMI)
> * Confirm that the Accept header matches the data encoding expected by your collector (application/yang-data+json)
> * Review the telemetry subscription configuration. If the sample interval is too long or too short, adjust it to balance between data granularity and resource usage
> * Verify that credentials used for HTTPS or gRPC are correct and that certificates are trusted (or properly bypassed in lab environments)
---
### Insights:
> * Continuous telemetry allows for proactive troubleshooting, enabling network teams to address issues before they escalate into major outages
> * Telemetry data can drive automated network adjustments and be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, improving overall agility
> * Detailed telemetry data can help detect anomalies or security breaches, serving as a vital component of a networks defense-in-depth strategy
> * As networks become more complex and software-define, the role of telemetry will only increase. Keeping up with evolving protocols (like gNMI) and data models (YANG) is essential for modern network managements
