# CoPP - Control Plane Policing
*RFC 2474 (defines DS field), RFC 2475 (provides architecture for DS), RFC 4594 (config guidelines for DS)*

## Overview
• CoPP is a security mechanism on Cisco devices that protects the control plane from traffic floods, DoS attacks or other unwanted traffic that could disrupt device operations  
• By applying rate limits and filtering policies, CoPP ensures that only legitimate traffic reaches the control plane  
• CoPP is a vital technique for protecting Cisco devices by regulating the flow of traffic to the control plane  
• CoPP classifies and polices traffic based on protocol and source, CoPP minimizes the risk of control plane overload and DoS attacks, thereby maintaining device stability and performance

## Terminology/Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Control Plane** | The part of a network device responsible for routing protocols, network management traffic and other signaling processes. It handles critical tasks like routing updates and protocol exchanges |
| **Data Plane** | The component that forwards user traffic through the device based on the control plane's decisions |
| **CoPP** | A mechanism that uses ACLs and QoS policies to rate-limit and filter traffic destined for the control plane. Its goal is to prevent excessive traffic from overwhelming critical processing functions |
| **ACL** | A set of rules used to permit or deny traffic based on criteria such as source/destination IP addresses, protocol type and port numbers. ACLs are key in CoPP for classifying control plane traffic |
| **Class-Map** | A mechanism used to classify traffic into different categories based on match criteria. In CoPP, class-maps identify different types of control plane traffic |
| **Policy-Map** | A configuration tool that defines how traffic (classified by class-maps) should be handled, such as applying rate limits or setting drop actions |
| **QoS** | Techniques that manage bandwidth, delay and packet loss. CoPP uses QoS policies to enforce rate limits and prioritization for control plane traffic |
| **Rate Limiting** | The process of controlling the rate at which traffic is allowed into the control plane to prevent resource exhaustion |

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
• **Protect the Control Plane** → Safeguard critical processing and routing functions from excessive or malicious traffic  
• **Prevent DoS Attacks** → Mitigate the impact of DoS attacks by rate limiting potentially harmful traffic  
• **Ensure Stability** → Maintain the performance and responsiveness of the control plane during high traffic loads  
• **Classify and Prioritize** → Differentiate between types of control plane traffic, allowing essential protocols (like routing updates) to get priority treatment

### When To Use CoPP
• On devices that are vulnerable to control plane traffic floods  
• In environments where multiple services share the same device  
• As part of a layered security approach to complement other protections (like MPP)

## Cisco Implementation

### Core Implementation Method
Cisco devices implement CoPP by applying QoS policies (using class-maps and policy-maps) to traffic destined for the control plane. These policies are then bound to the control plane interface. The policies filter and shape traffic, ensuring that the control plane receives only as much traffic as it can handle.

### Key Implementation Concepts

| Concept | Description | Implementation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Traffic Classification** | Identify control plane traffic by matching protocol types | Use class-maps to match protocols (ICMP, BGP, SSH, SNMP) |
| **Policy Enforcement** | Define actions for each traffic class | Create policy-maps that specify rate limiting, policing or dropping |
| **Binding the Policy** | Apply the policy to the control plane | Use `control-plane` command or dedicated control plane interfaces |

## Key Benefits

| Benefit | Description | Impact |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Traffic Filtering** | Protects the router's control plane by filtering out malicious or unnecessary traffic destined for it | Ensures only legitimate traffic (routing updates, management) reaches the CPU |
| **Prevention of DoS Attacks** | Polices traffic to the control plane, helping prevent DoS attacks | Excessive traffic is dropped or rate-limited, preserving CPU resources |
| **Resource Preservation** | Ensures control plane is not overwhelmed by unnecessary packets | Maintains stable routing and management functions during traffic surges |
| **Improved Convergence** | Fewer extraneous packets reaching the CPU | Routing protocols can converge more reliably, leading to quicker recovery from failures |
| **Granular Control** | Define specific policies based on various criteria | Rate-limit or drop traffic based on protocol type, source/destination address or port numbers |
| **Prioritization** | Prioritize critical control traffic over less important traffic | Routing protocol messages can be given higher priority than SNMP or management traffic |
| **Logging and Monitoring** | Include logging of traffic drops and violations | Provides insights into control plane health and identifies abnormal patterns or security incidents |

---

## Use Cases

| Environment | Application |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Enterprise Edge Routers and Switches** | Protect control plane functions on devices handling high-volumes of management traffic and routing traffic |
| **Service Provider Devices** | In multi-tenant or high-traffic environments, CoPP prevents control plane overloads, ensuring continued protocol exchanges and management access |
| **Data Centers and Cloud Networks** | Maintains stability and performance in complex environments where control plane stability is critical to service delivery |

## Best Practices/Security Considerations

### Configuration Guidelines
• **Understand specific control plane requirements** of your network. Rate limits should be set based on the expected load from essential protocols  
• **Use distinct class-maps** for critical protocols like OSPF, BGP and EIGRP to ensure they receive appropriate priority  
• **Always test in sandbox/lab environments** before production deployment

### Ongoing Management
• **Periodically audit and adjust** your CoPP policies as network traffic patterns change  
• **Maintain thorough documentation** of all CoPP policies, class-maps and ACLs for troubleshooting and future audits  
• **Follow rigorous change management process** for any modifications to CoPP settings to prevent disruptions

### Layered Security Approach
• **Deploy CoPP alongside other security mechanisms** (ACLs, DHCP Snooping, DAI) to provide layered security  
• **CoPP should be part of comprehensive security** that includes MPP, AAA, secure management protocols and additional filtering where necessary

### Monitoring and Alerting
• **Configure SNMP traps and Syslog alerts** for CoPP violations to ensure timely detection and response to suspicious activity  
• **Maintain clear documentation** of all CoPP configurations, including the reasoning behind specific rate limits and policies

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions
• **Verify rate limits are appropriately set** for expected traffic volumes  
• **Ensure critical protocols are not inadvertently matched** by a restrictive ACL  
• **Double check class-map definitions** to ensure correct protocol matching

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Review CoPP policy statistics** to identify dropped traffic  
2. **Check class-map match criteria** for accuracy  
3. **Verify rate limits** against actual traffic requirements  
4. **Examine logs** for CoPP violations and patterns

## Insights

### Traffic Segregation
• **CoPP segregates control traffic from user traffic** ensuring that attacks or misbehaving user traffic does not compromise the router's decision-making process  
• **By filtering out unexpected or high-volume traffic** CoPP helps protect against various attacks, such as ICMP floods, routing protocol spoofing or other attempts to overload the control plane

### Configuration Considerations
• **Overly aggressive CoPP policies** can inadvertently block legitimate control traffic. It is crucial to tune the rate limits and thresholds carefully through lab testing and monitoring before full deployment  
• **Consider implementing fallback mechanisms or redundancy** to ensure that if a CoPP policy is misconfigured, it does not lead to complete control plane isolation

### Implementation Strategy
• **Start with conservative rate limits** and gradually adjust based on monitoring and requirements  
• **Test thoroughly in lab environments** before implementing in production  
• **Monitor control plane performance** after CoPP implementation to ensure optimal operation
