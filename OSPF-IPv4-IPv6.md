# OSPF - RFC 2328 (OSPFv2, IPv4), RFC 5340 (OSPFv3, IPv6)

### Overview
* A link-state IGP protocol used within an AS  
* Builds a complete map of the network (LSDB) and calculates shortest path to each destination  
* OSPF scales well in large enterprise networks thanks to its use of areas, reducing the size of LSDBs  
* Priority and RID (loopback IP takes precedence or highest active IP) are used to elect DR/BDR  
---
### Timers 
> * Hello Timer *broadcast and P2P* = 10 sec || Dead Timer = 40 sec (x4 Hello)  
> * Hello Timer *NBMA, serial, Frame Relay* = 30 sec || Dead Timer = 120 sec (x4 Hello)  
> * LSA Refresh Timer = 1800 sec (30 min) || LSA Retransmission Timer = 5 sec  
> * LSA MaxAge Timer = 3600 sec (60 min)  
---
### Multicast:
> * IPv4 Multicast (OSPFv2)
> * All OSPF Routers: 224.0.0.5
> * DR/BDR Routers: 224.0.0.6
> * IPv6 Multicast (OSPFv3)
> * All OSPF Routers: FF02::5
> * All DR/BDR Routers: FF02::6
---
### Protocol/Port:
> * IP: 89
---
### Priorities:
> * Administrative Distance: 110
---
### Terminology/Definitions:
> * Router ID (RID) – a unique 32-bit number that identifies each OSPF router (often the highest IP on an active interface)
> * LSA – packets used by OSPF to exchange routing and topology information
> * LSDB – a collection of LSAs that form a map of the network
> * Adjacency – a relationship between two OSPF routers that exchange routing information
> * DR – acts as  a central point in exchanging LSAs; generates network LSAs
> * BDR – takes over if DR fails
> * Internal Router – generates router link LSAs
> * ABR –
> * ASBR –
---
### OSPF Packet Types:
> * Hello (1) – establishes and maintains neighbor relationships
> * BDB (2) – summarizes LSDB; used during the initial exchange
> * LSR (3) – requests more detailed LSA information
> * LSU (4) – sends requested LSAs to neighbors
> * LSAck (5) – confirms receipt of LSAs
---
### Adjacency States:
> * Down – no information is being exchanged
> * Init – a router has received a Hello but two-way communication is not established; the local RID is not listed in the neighbors Hello
> * 2-way – bidirectional communication is confirmed; on multi-access networks(broadcast networks) this state is used to elect DR/BDR
> * ExStart – the start of database exchange; router decides if either M or S will describe their LSDB
> * Exchange – routers exchange DBD packets summarizing their LSDB
> * Loading – routers request more missing or new LSAs via LSRs and respond with LSUs
> * Full – adjacency is fully established; databases are synchronized
---
### Network Types:
> * Broadcast (Ethernet) – elects DR/BDR to reduce flooding; all other routers are DROTHER
> * NBMA (frame relay) – ????
> * Point-to-Point – no DR/BDR needed; simplified adjacency, one neighbor per interface; uses Type 1 LSA; does not appear as a separate LSA in the LSDB, it is recorded as a direct connection between two routers
> * Point-to-Multipoint – treats each subinterface as a separate adjacency, no DR/DBR on each link
> * Loopback – OSPF sees loopbacks as a stub host unless configured otherwise
---
> * *DB/BDR Election:* Routers in a broadcast or NBMA segment choose DR/BDR based on highest OSPF priority. Priority 0 means the router is ineligible to be DR/BDR. A tie results in the highest RID winning. DR is responsible for flooding LSAs to others in the segment; BDR takes over if DR fails. Once elected, DR/BDRs do not preempt; so set OSPF priorities carefully.
---
### Areas / Hierarchical Design:
> * Backbone (Area 0) – core area; all non-backbone areas must connect to Area 0 (directly or via virtual links); acts as the central hub for inter-area route exchange
> * Non-Backbone Areas (normal areas) – regular areas that can contain any LSA types (inter-area and intra-area routes)
> * Stub Area – does not receive external (Type 5) LSAs; uses a default route to the ABR; the ABR injects a default route to Type 3 LSA for everything external
> * Totally Stubby Area (Cisco proprietary) – further restricts LSAs (blocks Type 5 and Type 3); allowing only a default route and intra-area routes. The ABR sends a single default route
> * NSSA – similar to stub area but allows a limited form of external routes via Type 7 LSAs injected by an ASBR inside the NSSA
> * Totally NSSA – a variant that restricts summary LSAs from other areas in addition to external routes
> * Virtual Links – used to connect non-contiguous Area 0 segments over a non-backbone area; configured between ABRs that share a common non-backbone area
---
### OSPF LSA Types: (Types 1-5, 7,8 is IPv4) (Types 1-5, 7,8 9-11 is IPv6)
> * Type 1 (Router LSA) – generated by every router; contains information about the routers directly connected interfaces; used in Point-to-Point connections; flooded within the local area only
> * Type 2 (Network LSA) – generated by DR on broadcast (Ethernet) and NBMA networks; describes all routers connected to the network; generated only on multi-access networks; OSPF does not generate Type 2 LSA when only one device is present; flooded within the area
> * Type 3 (Summary LSA) – generated by ABRs; advertises inter-area routes; summarization typically happens here
> * Type 4 (ASBR Summary LSA) – generated by ABR; advertises a route to an ASBR
> * Type 5 (External LSA) – generated by ASBR; used to advertise routes redistributed into OSPF from other routing protocols like BGP or static routes. Flooded throughout OSPF unless blocked by stub rules
> * Type 7 LSA – used in NSSA areas to advertise external routes; converted to Type 5 by ABR when crossing into the backbone
> * Type 9 LSA –
> * Type 10 LSA –
> * Type 11 LSA – 
---
### OSPF Route Types:
> * Intra-Area Routes – routes within the same area; uses SPF algorithm
> * Inter-Area Routes – routes between different areas, advertised as summary LSAs
> * External Routes – routes from outside the OSPF AS
>   * Type 1 External (E1) – sum of the internal cost to the ASBR plus the external cost
>   * Type 2 External (E2) – cost is based solely on external metrics (default in most cases)
>   * NSSA External Type 1 (N1) –
>   * NSSA External Type 2 (N2) –
---
### OSPF Route Prioritization:
> * O → O IA → N1 → E1 → N2 → E2
> * O –
> * O IA –
> * N1 –
> * E1 –
> * N2 –
> * E2 –
---
### OSPF Authentication Options:
> * Null Auth – no auth; default
> * Simple Password – a plain-text password
> * MD5 Auth – provides integrity and authenticity
> * OSPFv3 (IPv6) – Auth is handled by IPsec layer rather than with OSPF itself
---
### Header Breakdown & Definitions:
##### OSPF Common Header =  
> * | Version | Type | Packet Length | RID | Area ID | Checksum | AuType | Authentication |
>   * 1 - Version (2 for IPv4, 3 for IPv6)  
>   * 1 - Type (1 = Hello, 2 = DBD, 3 = LSR, 4 = LSU, 5 = LSAck)  
>   * 2 - Packet Length (header + payload length)  
>   * 4 - RID (unique ID of router sending packet)  
>   * 4 - Area ID (area ID which packet belongs; 0.0.0.0 for Area 0)  
>   * 2 - Checksum  
>   * 2 - AuType (0 = no auth, 1 = plain-text, 2 = MD5 or cryptographic)  
>   * 8 - Authentication (password, MD5 or zeroed)  
*OSPFv3 for IPv6 auth is handled differently*  

##### OSPF Common Header Definitions:



##### OSPF Hello Packet (Type 1) = 
Purpose: Hello packets discover neighbors, elect DR/BDR on broadcast/NBMA networks and ensure two-way communication; maintains adjacencies
> * | Common Header | Network Mask | Hello Int | Options | Router Prio. | Dead Int | DR | BDR | Neighbor ID |
>   * 4 - Network Mask (subnet mask of sending interface)
>   * 2 - Hello Interval
>   * 1 - Options (bitmask describing OSPF capabilities)
>   * 1 - Router Priority (used in DR/DBR election)
>     * 1 = default 
>     * 0 = ineligible
>   * 4 - Dead Interval 
>   * 4 - DR (IP of current DR on segment; 0.0.0.0 if none)
>   * 4 - BDR (IP of current DBR; 0.0.0.0 if none)
>   * variable - Neighbor IDs
##### OSPF Hello Packet (Type 1) Header Definitions:
> * Neighbor IDs – list of RIDs from which Hellos have been seen on this interface within the Dead interval
